**Breaking Changes:**

- Changes to how React and web apps are built:
  - Builds are now generated in `dist/` instead of `public/build/`
  - `index.html` for builds is now generated based on a template in `src/index.html`, instead of using a static `public/index.html`

    **Upgrading existing projects:**

    - move your `public/index.html` to `src/index.html` and delete the `<link>` and `<script>` tags for `vendor` and `app` resources. These will now be injected at build time.
    - replace `/public/build` in your `.gitignore` with `/dist/`

  - `public/` is now only for public files - any contents in this directory will now be copied to `dist/` at the start of a build. The development server will also serve static content from `public/`.

**Removed:**

- Backwards compatibility for `nwb.config.js` format changes made in 0.8.

**Added:**

- Added a `--host` option when running the dev server
- The `ExtractTextPlugin` used to extract CSS when building can now be configured using `webpack.plugins.extractText` config - this allows you to configure the `allChunks` setting if you want all CSS to be extracted when using code splitting.
- The `HtmlWebpackPlugin` used to generate an `index.html` when building can now be configured using `webpack.plugins.html` config.

**Changed:**

- Static resources handled by Webpack's `file-loader` now include a hash in their filenames for cachebusting when they change.

**Dependencies:**

# 0.8.1 / 2016-03-03

**Dependencies:**

- karma-mocha-reporter: v1.2.2 → [v1.2.3](https://github.com/litixsoft/karma-mocha-reporter/compare/v1.2.2...v1.2.3) - don't fail test suites containing skipped tests

# 0.8.0 / 2016-02-26

**Breaking Changes:**

- [`npm-install-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/ericclemmons/npm-install-webpack-plugin) is now used instead of `npm-install-loader` to implement `nwb serve --auto-install`.

  If you were configuring automatic npm installation using a `loaders.install.query.cli` config object, this should be moved to `webpack.plugins.install` instead.

**Changed:**

*`nwb.config.js` format changes:*

> nwb v0.8 will support the old format and display warning messages about the changes required before upgrading to nwb v0.9.

1. React component and vanilla JS module npm build configuration must now be specificed as a `build` object:

  ```js
  // < v0.9
  module.exports = {
    type: 'react-component',
    externals: {react: 'React'},
    global: 'MyComponent',
    jsNext: true,
    umd: true
  }
  ```
  ```js
  // v0.9
  module.exports = {
    type: 'react-component',
    build: {
      externals: {react: 'React'},
      global: 'MyComponent',
      jsNext: true,
      umd: true
    }
  }
  ```
1. Webpack configuration must now be specified as a `webpack` object:

  ```js
  // < v0.9
  module.exports = {
    type: 'react-app',
    loaders: {
      css: {
        query: {
          modules: true
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  ```js
  // v0.9
  module.exports = {
    type: 'react-app',
    webpack: {
      loaders: {
        css: {
          query: {
            modules: true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
1. Webpack `define` config must now be specified in a `plugins` object:

  ```js
  // < v0.9
  module.exports = {
    type: 'react-app',
    define: {
      __VERSION__: JSON.stringify(require('./package.json').version)
    }
  }
  ```
  ```js
  // v0.9
  module.exports = {
    type: 'react-app',
    webpack: {
      plugins: {
        define: {
          __VERSION__: JSON.stringify(require('./package.json').version)
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
1. All "extra" Webpack config must be specified in a an `extra` object, including extra loaders. The new object must correspond with Webpack's config file layout.

  ```js
  // < v0.9
  module.exports = {
    type: 'react-app',
    loaders: {
      extra: [/* ... */]
    }
  }
  ```
  ```js
  // v0.9
  module.exports = {
    type: 'react-app',
    webpack: {
      extra: {
        module: {
          loaders: [/* ... */]
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

**Changes:**

- `nwb.config.js` is now only required when running generic build commands: `build`, `clean`, `serve`, `test`
  - `type` config is only required when running a generic build command, but if provided it must be valid.
- Karma tests now always run just once in a CI environment regardless of the `--server` flag - this allows you to use `--server` in your default `npm test` command if you want to, without needing a separate run script for CI.
- Development instructions in project templates were moved from `README.md` to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, and are now documented using `npm` and `npm run` commands instead of global `nwb` commands.
- All commands are now run in the current working directory - you no longer need to `require.resolve()` full paths to extra Babel plugins configured in `nwb.config.js`, just use their names as normal and Babel will now be able to import them.
- Upgraded to PhantomJS v2 for Karma tests.
  - Babel polyfills are no longer included in Webpack config for Karma, as PhantomJS v2 uses a more recent version of WebKit.

**Added:**

- Extra webpack config can now be configured via a `webpack.extra` Object.
  - To support adding other webpack built-in plugins via `extra`, if a function is exported from `nwb.config.js`, it will now be called with an object containing the following properties:
    - `command` - the nwb command being executed
    - `webpack` - the webpack module (for configuring extra plugins using nwb's version of webpack)
- Project type-specific versions of the `build`, `clean` and `serve` commands are now officially documented for direct use.
- A `test:watch` npm script was added to project template `package.json`.

# 0.7.2 / 2016-01-15

**Fixed:**

# 0.7.0 / 2016-01-05

**Fixed:**

- Fall back to nwb's dependencies in Webpack config instead of using an alias so `babel-runtime` can be picked up when `optional: ['runtime']` is used [hopefully fixing the weird `/node_modules/node_modules/` issue seen in [[#37](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/37)]

**Added:**

- Added an `--auto-install` flag to `nwb serve` which automatically installs npm dependencies and saves them to your package.json while developing.

**Removed:**

- `jsNext` config no longer defaults to `true` if not present.

**Changed:**

- Use `.x` for dependencies when generating skeleton project `package.json` instead of range sigils.

**Dependencies:**

- babel-runtime: v5.8.34 → v5.8.29 - downgraded due to a regression in typeof-react-element.js when used in conjunction with `optional: ['runtime']`
- karma: v0.13.16 → [v0.13.18](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/releases/tag/v0.13.18)

# 0.6.3 / 2015-12-31

**Fixed:**

- Exit the process correctly with a non-zero exit code when an async command fails, such as `nwb test` [[#36](https://github.com/insin/nwb/pull/36)] [[jihchi][jihchi]]

**Dependencies:**

- karma-mocha-reporter: v1.1.4 → v1.1.5 - show error message when karma runner ends with error
- webpack-merge: v0.5.1 → v0.7.0 - bug fix for merging arrays within nested structures

# 0.6.2 / 2015-12-30

**Dependencies:**

- argv-set-env: v1.0.0 → [v1.0.1](https://github.com/kentcdodds/argv-set-env/releases/tag/v1.0.1) - docs
- glob: v6.0.1 → v6.0.3 - v6.0.2 was reverted

- webpack-merge: v0.3.2 → v0.5.1 - fix recursive merging

# 0.6.1 / 2015-12-30

**Fixed:**

- The `es6/` directory wasn't included in the default `.gitignore` for npm module project templates.

# 0.6.0 / 2015-12-23

**Added:**

- Added an `nwb init` command - same as `nwb new` but creates a project in the current directory and uses the directory name by default [[#25](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/25)]
- Added a new `web-app` project type - this is for anyone who wants to use nwb's build/serve/test setup but isn't using React [[#24](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/24)]
- Added a `--reload` option to auto-reload the page when webpack hot module replacement gets stuck. This is primarily intended for use with the new `web-app` project type.
- Command-line arguments can now be used to configure settings for `nwb new`.

**Fixed:**

- Production optimisations weren't being applied to React app builds.
- Demo apps weren't generating sourcemaps when bundling.
- Use a non-zero exit code when displaying usage or otherwise exiting due to missing arguments [[#23](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/23)]

**Changed:**

- Reorganised and coloured `nwb help` output.
- Commands which create files now log details of what they've created [[#26](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/26)]
- The ES6 modules build for npm modules is now optional, controlled by a `jsNext` setting in `nwb.config.js`, defaulting to `true` [[#27](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/27)]
  - nwb 0.6 will default `jsNext` to `true` and log a warning when it's missing from a config file - this behaviour will be removed in nwb v0.7.

**Dependencies:**

- copy-template-dir: v1.1.0 → v1.2.0 - provide created file paths in callback
- css-loader: v0.23.0 → v0.23.1
- expect: v1.13.3 → v1.13.4 - comparing arrays of nested objects fix
- rimraf: v2.4.4 → v2.4.5

# 0.5.0 / 2015-12-15

**Added:**

- Top-level Webpack config can now be provided for loaders which support it, as a `config` object in their `nwb.config.js` `loaders` configuration. This is intended for loaders which can't use serialisable `query` config due to plugins, such as some CSS preprocessors [[#18](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/18)]

**Fixed:**

- `files` config from template `package.json` was being used when packing nwb for publishing. Renamed them to `_package.json` to avoid this [[#22](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/22)]

**Changed:**

- Downgraded qs dependency so nwb can be used with Node.js 0.12.x [[#19](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/19)]

**Dependencies:**

- copy-template-dir: v1.0.5 → v1.1.0 - rename all files beginning with `_`
- expect: v1.13.0 → v1.13.3 - `Map`, `Set` and circular comparison fixes
- qs: v6.0.0 → v5.2.0 - downgrade to lose Node.js >= 4.0.0 requirement

# 0.4.1 / 2015-12-13

**Fixed:**

- Bad npm package for 0.4.0 - npm was reading the new `files` config from `package.json` in templates for React components/web modules and applying it when packing nwb itself for publishing [[#21](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/21)]

# 0.4.0 / 2015-12-11

**Added:**

- Added `--fallback` option to `nwb serve`, for serving the index page from any path when developing React apps which use the HTML5 History API [[#16](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/16)]
- Added `"engines": {"node": ">=4.0.0"}` to `package.json` - nwb accidentally depends on this because it uses [qs](https://github.com/hapijs/qs) v6 [[#19](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/19)]
- Added `files` config to React component/web module `package.json` templates.
  - The `files` config for the React component template assumes that components published to npm with `require()` calls for CSS which ships with it will use a `css/` dir.
- Added a default ES6 build with untranspiled ES6 module usage [[#15](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/15)]
  - This is pointed to by `jsnext:main` in project template `package.json` for use by tree-shaking ES6 bundlers.

**Fixed:**

- Added missing `main` config to React component/web module `package.json` templates, pointing at the ES5 build in `lib/`.
- Express middleware wasn't included in npm package.

**Changed:**

- 1.0.0 is now the default version for template projects.

# 0.3.1 / 2015-12-09

**Fixed:**

- Generic `nwb build` was broken for React components/web modules in 0.3.0.

# 0.3.0 / 2015-12-07

**Added:**

- Support for CSS preprocessor plugin packages [[#6](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/6)]
  - Loading of configuration objects exported by `'nwb-*'` dependencies found in `package.json`.
  - Creation of style loading pipelines for plugins which provide `cssPreprocessors` configuration.
    - [nwb-less](https://github.com/insin/nwb-less)
    - [nwb-sass](https://github.com/insin/nwb-sass)

**Fixed:**

- Babel config is now passed to Babel when transpiling modules [[#13](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/13)]

# 0.2.0 / 2015-12-05

**Added:**

- Express [middleware](https://github.com/insin/nwb/blob/master/docs/Middleware.md#middleware) for running a React app on your own development server using nwb's Webpack config generation [[#8](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/8)]

**Changed:**

- Webpack loader config objects are now merged with [webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge); query objects will now be deep merged, with lists occurring at the same position in build and user config being concatenated instead of overwritten.

**Fixed:**

- babel-runtime can now be resolved from nwb's dependencies when using `optional: ['runtime']` Babel config [[#10](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/10)]
- Paths to resources required from CSS in React app builds [[#9](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/9)]

# 0.1.0 / 2015-12-02

First 0.x release.
